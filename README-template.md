## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### Continued development

I struggled a lot with the positioning of background images. The current version has hardcoded positioning coordinates that are relative to the 1440px/720px and 375px/721px screens. Beyond those dimentions the images look off.

Any advice on how I can make it more reponsive to the screens?
